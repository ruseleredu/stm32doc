Summary of Git Best Practices

Commit Often
Write Clear Commit Messages
Use Branches
Pull Before You Push
Review Changes Before Committing
Keep Repositories Small
Use .gitignore
Tag Releases

## Commit Often

Make small, frequent commits to capture your progress.

This makes it easier to track changes and find bugs.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add user authentication logic"
```

## Write Clear Commit Messages

Use descriptive messages that explain why a change was made, not just what changed.

Good commit messages help you and your team understand the history of the project.

Be specific: Say what and why, not just "Update" or "Fix".
Use the imperative mood: For example, "Add login validation" instead of "Added login validation".

```bash
git commit -m "Fix bug in user login validation"
```

## Use Branches

Create branches for features, fixes, and experiments to keep your main branch stable.

This way, you can work on new ideas without affecting the main codebase.

Why? Branches let you test and develop independently, and make collaboration safer.
Name branches clearly: For example, feature/login-form or bugfix/user-auth.

```bash
git checkout -b feature/login-form
```

## Pull Before You Push

Always git pull before pushing.

This updates your local branch with changes from others, helps you avoid conflicts, and ensures your push will succeed.

Why? If someone else has pushed changes since your last pull, your push may be rejected or cause conflicts.

Pulling first lets you fix any issues locally.

```bash
git pull origin main
git push origin main
```

## Review Changes Before Committing

Use git status and git diff to review your changes before you commit.

This helps you catch mistakes early.

```bash
git status
git diff
```

## Keep Repositories Small

Avoid adding large files or unnecessary dependencies.

This keeps your repository fast and easy to clone.

Tip: For large files (like videos or datasets), use Git LFS (Large File Storage) instead of adding them directly to your repo.

## Use .gitignore

Exclude files that shouldn't be tracked (like build artifacts, log files, or secrets) by adding them to a .gitignore file.

Note: .gitignore only prevents new files from being tracked.

Files already tracked by Git will remain in the repository until you remove them with `git rm --cached <file>`.

```bash
# .gitignore
node_modules/
*.log
.env
```

## Tag Releases

Use tags to mark release points (like v1.0) so you can easily find and reference important versions.

This helps you keep track of your project's history and make it easier to roll back to previous versions if needed.

```bash
git tag v1.0
git push origin v1.0
```

Note: Good Git habits make it easier for your team (and your future self) to understand and build on your work.
