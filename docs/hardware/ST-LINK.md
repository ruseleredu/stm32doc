## Guide

This small guide will explain how to connect your debugger to your development board. There are two commonly used connectors which expose only the SWD (Serial Wire Debug) interface or the full JTAG interface.

### ST-LINK/V2 Clone

The cheapest alternative to both official ST options is a Chinese ST-LINK/V2 clone. This clone offers the same connectivity when it comes to SWD. It does not expose a full JTAG interface. However, it does feature some additional power pins, both +5V and +3.3V.

This debugger has a 10-pin IDC connector. The pinout of this connector can be found below.
