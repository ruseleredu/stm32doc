PlatformIO Unit Testing allows you to segregate each part of the firmware/program and test that the individual parts are working correctly. Using PlatformIO you can execute the same tests on the local host machine (native), on the multiple local embedded devices/boards (connected to local host machine), or on both. When testing both, PlatformIO builds firmware on the host machine, uploads it into a target device, starts tests and collects the test results into test reports. The final information will be shown on the host side with informative output and statistics.
