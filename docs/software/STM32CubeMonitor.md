## Monitoring tool to test STM32 applications at run-time

The STM32CubeMonitor family of tools helps to fine-tune and diagnose STM32 applications at run-time by reading and visualizing their variables in real-time. In addition to specialized versions (power, RF, USB-PD), the versatile STM32CubeMonitor provides a flow-based graphical editor to build custom dashboards simply, and quickly add widgets such as gauges, bar graphs and plots. With non-intrusive monitoring, STM32CubeMonitor preserves the real-time behavior of applications, and perfectly complements traditional debugging tools to perform application profiling.
