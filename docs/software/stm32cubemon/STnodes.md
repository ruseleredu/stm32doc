## List of specific ST nodes

- [List of specific ST nodes](https://wiki.st.com/stm32mcu/wiki/STM32CubeMonitor:List_of_specific_ST_nodes)

## Design nodes
These nodes are used to create flows from target to variable, rendered in dashboard view. Design nodes are not visible on the dashboard. 

### Acquisition out
This allows the user to define and/or select a probe configuration (probe name, protocol and frequency). This node opens and closes the connection, and send commands to the selected probe.

See [STM32CubeMonitor:How to select the target](https://wiki.st.com/stm32mcu/wiki/STM32CubeMonitor:How_to_select_the_target) for further details. 

## Dashboard nodes

These nodes are visible in dashboard mode; they allow the user to visualize or modify variables used on the target.
